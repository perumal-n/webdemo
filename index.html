        <p>Peacock<br/><br/>
            Peafowl is a common name for two bird species of the genus Pavo and one species of the closely related genus
            Afropavo within the tribe Pavonini of the family Phasianidae (the pheasants and their allies). Male peafowl
            are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens.
            The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally from the Indian subcontinent, and the
            green peafowl from Southeast Asia. The Congo peafowl, native only to the Congo Basin, is not a true peafowl.
            The functions of the elaborate iridescent coloration and large "train" of peacocks have been the subject of
            extensive scientific debate. Charles Darwin suggested that they served to attract females, and the showy
            features of the males had evolved by sexual selection. More recently, Amotz Zahavi proposed in his handicap
            principle that these features acted as honest signals of the males' fitness, since less-fit males would be
            disadvantaged by the difficulty of surviving with such large and conspicuous structures.<br /><br />

        <p>Parrot<br/><br/>
            Parrots, also known as psittacines are birds with a strong curved
            beak, upright stance, and clawed feet. They are classified in four families that contain roughly 410
            species in 101 genera, found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. The four families are the
            Psittaculidae (Old World parrots), Psittacidae (African and New World parrots), Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and
            Strigopidae (New Zealand parrots). One-third of all parrot species are threatened by extinction, with a
            higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other comparable bird group.[3] Parrots have
            a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions as well. The greatest
            diversity of parrots is in South America and Australasia.[5]

            Parrots—along with ravens, crows, jays, and magpies—are among the most intelligent birds, and the ability of
            some species to imitate human speech enhances their popularity as pets. They form the most variably sized
            bird order in terms of length; many are vividly coloured and some, multi-coloured. Most parrots exhibit
            little or no sexual dimorphism in the visual spectrum.<br><br />

        <p>flamingo<br/><br/>
            flamingo, (order Phoenicopteriformes), any of six species of tall, pink wading birds with thick downturned
            bills. Flamingos have slender legs, long, graceful necks, large wings, and short tails. They range from
            about 90 to 150 cm (3 to 5 feet) tall.Flamingos are highly gregarious birds. Flocks numbering in the
            hundreds may be seen in long, curving flight formations and in wading groups along the shore. On some of
            East Africas large lakes, more than a million lesser flamingos (Phoeniconaias minor) gather during the
            breeding season. In flight, flamingos present a striking and beautiful sight, with legs and neck stretched
            out straight, looking like white and rosy crosses with black arms. No less interesting is the flock at rest,
            with their long necks twisted or coiled upon the body in any conceivable position. Flamingos are often seen
            standing on one leg. Various reasons for this habit have been suggested, such as regulation of body
            temperature, conservation of energy, or merely to dry out the legs.<br /><br /> <a

        <p>Swans<br/><br/>
            Swans are the largest extant members of the waterfowl family Anatidae and are among the largest flying birds.
            The largest living species, including the mute swan, trumpeter swan, and whooper swan, can reach a length of
            over 1.5 m and weigh over 15 kg . Their wingspans can be over 3.1 m (10 ft).Compared to
            the closely related geese, they are much larger and have proportionally larger feet and necks.Adults
            also have a patch of unfeathered skin between the eyes and bill. The sexes are alike in plumage, but males
            are generally bigger and heavier than females.[19] The biggest species of swan ever was the extinct Cygnus
            falconeri, a flightless giant swan known from fossils found on the Mediterranean islands of Malta and
            Sicily. Its disappearance is thought to have resulted from extreme climate fluctuations or the arrival of
            superior predators and competitors.

            The Northern Hemisphere species of swan have pure white plumage, but the Southern Hemisphere species are
            mixed black and white. The Australian black swan (Cygnus atratus) is completely black except for the white
            flight feathers on its wings; the chicks of black swans are light grey. The South American black-necked swan
            has a white body with a black neck.

            The legs of most swans are typically a dark blackish-grey colour, except for the South American black-necked
            swan, which has pink legs. Bill colour varies: the four subarctic species have black bills with varying
            amounts of yellow, and all the others are patterned red and black. Although birds do not have teeth, swans,
            like other Anatidae, have beaks with serrated edges that look like small jagged "teeth" as part of their
            beaks used for catching and eating aquatic plants and algae, but also molluscs, small fish, frogs, and
            worms.[25] In the mute swan and black-necked swan, both sexes have a fleshy lump at the base of their bills
            on the upper mandible, known as the knob, which is larger in males and is condition dependent, changing
            seasonally.<br /><br />

        <p>bald eagle<br/><br/>
            The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a bird of prey found in North America. A sea eagle, it has two
            known subspecies and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), which occupies
            the same niche as the bald eagle in the Palearctic. Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the
            contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant
            food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.

            The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish, which it swoops down upon and
            snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest nest of any North American bird and the
            largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to 4 m (13 ft) deep, 2.5 m (8.2 ft) wide, and 1
            metric ton (1.1 short tons) in weight. Sexual maturity is attained at the age of four to five years.

            Bald eagles are not bald; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, "white headed". The adult is
            mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in plumage, but females are about 25
            percent larger than males. The yellow beak is large and hooked. The plumage of the immature is brown.

            The bald eagle is the national symbol of the United States of America and appears on its seal. In the late
            20th century it was on the brink of extirpation in the contiguous United States. Populations have since
            recovered, and the species's status was upgraded from "endangered" to "threatened" in 1995, and removed from
            the list altogether in 2007.<br /><br />

        <p>Hoopoes<br/><br/>
            Hoopoes are colourful birds found across Africa, Asia, and Europe, notable for their
            distinctive "crown" of feathers which can be raised or lowered at will. Three living and one extinct species
            are recognized, though for many years all of the extant species were lumped as a single species—Upupa epops.
            In fact, some taxonomists still consider all three species conspecific. Some authorities also keep the
            African and Eurasian hoopoe together but split the Madagascar hoopoe. The Eurasian hoopoe is common in its
            range and has a large population, so it is evaluated as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List of Threatened
            Species. However, their numbers are declining in Western Europe.[3] Conversely, the hoopoe has been
            increasing in numbers at the tip of the South Sinai, Sharm el-Sheikh. There are dozens of nesting pairs that
            remain resident all year round.
            The genus Upupa was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his
            Systema Naturae.[4] The type species is the Eurasian hoopoe (Upupa epops).[5] Upupa and ἔποψ (epops) are
            respectively the Latin and Ancient Greek names for the hoopoe; both, like the English name, are onomatopoeic
            forms which imitate the cry of the bird.

            The hoopoe was classified in the clade Coraciiformes, which also includes kingfishers, bee-eaters, and
            rollers.[8] A close relationship between the hoopoe and the wood hoopoes is also supported by the shared and
            unique nature of their stapes.[9] In the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, the hoopoe is separated from the
            Coraciiformes as a separate order, the Upupiformes. Some authorities place the wood hoopoes in the
            Upupiformes as well.[10] Now the consensus is that both hoopoe and the wood hoopoes belong with the
            hornbills in the Bucerotiformes.[11]

            The fossil record of the hoopoes is very incomplete, with the earliest fossil coming from the
            Quaternary.[12] The fossil record of their relatives is older, with fossil wood hoopoes dating back to the
            Miocene and those of an extinct related family, the Messelirrisoridae, dating from the
            Eocene.[10]<br /><br />
